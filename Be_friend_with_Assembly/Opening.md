# 1. Be Friend with Assembly
In this chpater, we learn about assembly language and how to use and read it. However, it is hard to learn assembly without any reference. Therefore, I choose the textbook which is most recommended in reddit. That is Link:["The Art of Assembly"][https://www.amazon.com/Art-Assembly-Language-2nd-dp-1593272073/dp/1593272073/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1586080984]. If you service in ROKA, you can buy this book using the Solider Self Development Support.
Each Chapter in this book is each folder in this repo. So, If you want to search about specified section, open that folder.
